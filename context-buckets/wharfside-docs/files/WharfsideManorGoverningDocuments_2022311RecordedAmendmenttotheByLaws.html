<p>WHEREAS, Section 19 of the Declaration of Restrictive and Protective Covenants (the “Declaration”) provides that, "...all charges and expenses chargeable to any Unit shall constitute a lien against said Unit in favor of Association...[;]” and</p>

  <div class="transcription">
    <p>cleaning, sanitation, renewal, replacement, care, upkeep, protection and surveillance of the buildings in the Condominium, the community and recreational facilities and all other property, real or personal, of the Association... (C) By majority vote of the Board, to adjust or increase any such assessments and to levy and collect in addition thereto, special assessments in such amounts as the Board may deem proper, whenever the Board is of opinion it is necessary to do so in order to meet increased operating or maintenance costs, or additional capital expenses, or because of emergencies... (N) To establish a working capital fund to insure that the Association will have funds available to meet unforeseen expenditures or to acquire additional equipment or services deemed necessary or desirable by the ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS</b>, the members of the Association wish to amend the By-Laws to establish a capital contribution equal to six (6) months of the monthly assessments, based upon the monthly assessments at the time of purchase; and</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS</b>, 10% of the members of the community did not vote to reject the proposed amendments and said amendments were deemed to pass automatically in accordance with <span style="color:red;">N.J.S.A.</span> 45:22A-46(d)(5)(b).</p>

<p><b>NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED</b> the Association hereby amends the By-Laws as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Article IV, Section 12 of the By-Laws is hereby added in its entirety:</p>

<p>Each purchaser, upon acquiring title to a Unit, shall, as a condition of membership in the Association, pay a capital contribution equal to six (6) months of the monthly assessments, based upon the monthly assessments at the time of purchase, which sum may be used for any lawful purpose by the Association.</p>

<p>The foregoing fee will be nonrefundable, nontransferable and shall not be credited to the purchaser by the Association upon sale by the purchaser of his, her, or their Unit. Such sums may be used for operating expenses or reserves that are not funded by the annual Common Expense Assessments collected from the Unit Owners or for any other lawful purpose at the discretion of the Board and need not be replenished if so utilized. These sums shall not be deemed a prepayment of the monthly installments of the Common Expense Assessments attributable to the Unit. Payment of said sums shall be a condition precedent to the exercise of rights of membership in the Association. Any unpaid capital contribution shall be deemed a lien on the Unit and shall be collectible by the Association in the same manner as any unpaid Common Expense Assessments attributable to such Unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All other terms and conditions of the Master Deeds, Declarations and By-Laws not amended shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should any provision hereof be determined to be invalid, the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
</li>

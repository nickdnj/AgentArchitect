    5. Any Special Assessment installment payment not posted in full with the Association by the due date listed above in Paragraph 4 is late;

6. Unit owners will be afforded a (10) day "grace period" in which to post their Special Assessment installment obligations without penalty;

7. Those unit owners who have not posted their Special Assessment installment obligation by the 11<sup>th</sup> day after the due date will be sent a "late notice" by the Association's property manager, which notice shall also indicate the assessment to the unit owner of a $10.00 late fee;

8. Should the unit owner's failure to pay the required Special Assessment obligation continue for a period of thirty (30) days, then the Board of Trustees will declare the unit owner's entire Special Assessment obligation due and owing ("accelerated") with interest at 18% per annum assessed on the entire unpaid balance from the date the installment first came due until paid in full. In addition, the unit owner's delinquent account shall be forwarded to legal counsel for the following action:

   a. At the unit owner's expense and upon notice to the unit owner, perfect the recording of a lien in the Office of the Monmouth County Clerk against the unit owner's Condominium unit;

   b. At the unit owner's expense, provide written notice to the unit owner's mortgage lender as to the unit owner's default in the payment of the unit owner's Special Assessment obligations;

   c. At the unit owner's expense, institute a civil action lawsuit seeking a Judgment against the unit owner in order to compel payment of the Special Assessment including all accrued late fees, interest, as well as the Association's attorney's fees and costs incurred incidental to bringing the unit owner's compliance with same;

   d. Suspend the unit owner's membership privileges in the Association (voting rights) and the privileges of any tenant and/or occupant of the unit owner's unit to use the common elements (i.e. parking spaces and pool) until the unit owner complies in remitting full payment of all delinquent Special Assessments obligations and other charges.

9. The Association shall reserve the right consistent with the recorded governing documents for Wharfside Manor Condominium Association, as well as the New Jersey Condominium Act, specifically N.J.S.A.46:8B-21 to institute and prosecute to a conclusion and at the unit owner's expense, a foreclosure proceeding against the delinquent unit owner's unit.

10. Once a unit owner becomes delinquent in the payment of any Special Assessment obligation and/or other charges, any amounts paid by the unit owner to the Association with regard to same shall be applied first to attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with any claim of lien and/or collection, then to accrued interest on the delinquent Special Assessment and/or charges, then to the outstanding principal amount of the Special Assessment.

11. Upon complete payment of all outstanding Special Assessments, accrued interest and/or other charges, including, but not limited to attorney's fees and costs, the Association's property manager shall so notify the Association's legal counsel who, in turn, shall prepare and record in the Office of the Monmouth County Clerk a "discharge of lien" executed by the Association.

12. To the extent that any one or more provisions of this Special Assessment Collection and Enforcement Policy shall be declared illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, all remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

The Complaint must set forth the acts or omissions complained of and shall be as specific as possible as to times, dates, places, and person involved. To the extent possible, the Complaint should specify the provision(s) of the Governing Documents alleged to have been violated.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Non-Binding Arbitration Date and Service.</strong> The Committee shall set a non-binding arbitration date that is within thirty (30) days of the Committee's receipt of the written Complaint. At least 10 days prior to any non-binding arbitration, the Committee shall serve a copy of the Complaint, or serve the details thereof which may be in the form of a letter (either document to be known as the "Notice of Non-Binding Arbitration"), upon the respondent by (1) personal service or (2) by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and via regular mail, addressed to respondent at the respondent's last known address. Service by mail will be deemed effective, in the event proof of certified mailing is not secured, if the regular mailing is not returned. No fine may be imposed, unless the respondent has been served as provided in this paragraph.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Contents of the Notice of Non-Binding Arbitration.</strong> The Notice of Non-Binding Arbitration must set forth the time, place and date of the non-binding arbitration. The Notice of Non-Binding Arbitration shall contain a statement that the respondent may be present at the non-binding arbitration; may, but need not be, represented by counsel; may present any relevant evidence; and be given full opportunity to cross-examine all witnesses and the production of books, documents, or other items by applying to the Board or managing agent.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Amended or Supplemental Complaints.</strong> At any time prior to the non-binding arbitration date, the Committee may file or permit the filing of an Amended or Supplemental Complaint. All parties must be notified in the same manner as notified of the original Complaint, and, if necessary, a new non-binding arbitration date. If new charges are presented, the respondent may file a Supplemental Answer.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Discovery.</strong> At any time after service of the Notice of Non-Binding Arbitration and prior to the date for non-binding arbitration, either party may request the Board or the Managing Agent to provide the names and addresses of witnesses to be called, and copies of any statements, writings, and investigative reports to be introduced at the non-binding arbitration. It shall be the obligation, however, of any individual to which such information is provided, to utilize same only for legitimate purposes in the context of the non-binding arbitration. Failure to do so shall subject the unit owner to liability and/or penalties.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Non-Binding Arbitration.</strong> The Committee will select a person who need not be an owner or a member of the Committee to preside as non-binding arbitration officer. It is the duty of the non-binding arbitration officer to explain the rules and procedures by which the non-binding arbitration is to be conducted. Generally, any relevant evidence may be admitted and hearsay evidence may be used to supplement or explain other evidence, but will not be sufficient in itself to support a finding. Counsel for the Association may be present at the non-binding arbitration and may serve as a non-binding arbitration officer.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>At the request of either complainant or respondent, or on its own motion, the Committee may conduct the non-binding arbitration in private session.</p>

  <li>b. Introduce evidence, testimony and witnesses;</li>
  <li>c. cross-examine opposing parties and witnesses;</li>
  <li>d. rebut evidence and testimony</li>
</ul>

<p>Technical rules of evidence or procedures may be relaxed by the non-binding arbitration officer who, nevertheless, may reserve the right to exclude all irrelevant, immaterial, or repetitious evidence. The non-binding arbitration officer also has the discretion to impose reasonable limits on the time allowed to testify and the number of witnesses.</p>

<p>In the event that the respondent fails to appear at the non-binding arbitration, the allegations in the complaint will be deemed true, the non-binding arbitration will not be held and the right to participate in alternate dispute resolution will be deemed waived.</p>

<p>Oral evidence may be taken only on oath or affirmation administered by the non-binding arbitration officer.</p>

<p>Whenever the Committee has commenced to hear a matter, and a member withdraws before a decision, the remaining members will continue to hear the case and the committee chairman will name a replacement for the withdrawing member who will make his decision from the existing record.</p>

<p><b>7. Challenges to the Committee.</b> Each member of the Committee must be able to perform in a disinterested and objective manner in consideration of the case before it, or must disqualify himself and have it so recorded in the minutes. Any member of the Committee may be challenged by any other member or by the complainant or the respondent for cause. The Board will decide the challenge and all decisions of the Board in this regard are final.</p>

<p><b>8. Committee Recommendation.</b> Within (30) days after a non-binding arbitration hearing on any matter, the Committee must issue a written recommendation on the matter, through the managing agent, if appropriate.

Copies of the recommendation must be delivered to the parties by personal service or regular mail.</p>

<p><b>9. Costs.</b> With regard to non-binding arbitration in which the Association is a party, any costs associated with the non-binding arbitration shall be borne by the Association.</p>

<p>However, in the event that the Association is not a party, any costs will be borne equally by the parties.</p>

<p><b>10. Miscellaneous.</b></p>

<li>Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, no Association documents shall be removed from the Office. Moreover, the Administrator shall determine when and where all documents shall be inspected and shall ensure that all documents are inspected in the presence of designated Association personnel.</li>

<li>Despite anything to the contrary in this Policy, the Association shall not be required to make Association documents available for inspection or copying for more than four (4) hours in any given week, regardless of the number of unit owner requests that may be pending unless the owner requesting same makes arrangements in advance with the Administrator for Association personnel to be present in excess of the allotted time, either during or outside of normal business hours. In any event such unit owner(s) shall pay to the Administrator an administrative charge of $45.00 per hour for all time in excess of this one (1) hour during which such personnel are utilized to fulfill any such request. Moreover the Administrator shall have the right to request in advance a deposit to cover the estimated amount of any such charge, with any excess to be promptly refunded to the owner upon fulfillment of the request.</li>

<li>Prior to providing any owner with access to the Association documents pursuant to this Policy, any owner or non-owner (who accompanies said owner) must execute a Confidentiality Agreement in the present of a witness, restricting the owner and/or non-owner from disclosing, either directly or indirectly, in any manner or form, any such information revealed within Confidential Documents listed under Paragraph 4 of this Policy, or otherwise deemed confidential, notwithstanding not being incorporated within those documents listed as "Confidential".</li>

<li>Access to the books, records and memoranda as set forth in Item numbers 1 through 6 shall be provided to owners who are in "good standing" at the time of the written request in the case of Permitted Documents (Item 3) or at the time of the Board vote on the individual disclosure request where such vote is required pursuant to this Policy. For purposes of this Policy, a member in "good standing" shall be defined as a member who has fully paid all installments due for assessments made or levied against the member and/or his or her Unit by the Board, together with all interest, costs, attorney fees, penalties, other expenses, if any, properly chargeable to the member and/or his or her Unit. Owners who seek to challenge a determination that they are not in good standing may review their own unit records and other records which are deemed reasonably related to the matter(s) that resulted in the owner's loss of good standing, such as: inspection reports concerning his/her own unit; the current Association budget; a statement of charges of account of the requesting owner; and correspondence with the owner directly related to the delinquent assessment(s) or fine(s).</li>

    <p><b>II. PROCEDURES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR INSTALLATION OF AN 
"OTARD" UPON AREAS WHOLLY WITHIN THE EXCLUSIVE OWNERSHIP, 
USE OR CONTROL OF THE RESIDENT.</b></p>

<p>A. The installation of an OTARD on the Common Elements is strictly prohibited. Any OTARD 
installations currently installed on the Common Elements must be removed and placed in 
the appropriate location as set forth in the Master Deed or contained in this Resolution. 
Should the Unit Owner or Tenant fail to remove the OTARD from the Common Elements 
after reasonable notice from the Board, the Association may fine and/or remove the OTARD 
and assess the cost of removal, together with the cost to repair and/or replace any damage 
to the Common Elements.</p>

<p>B. Residents are permitted to install an OTARD upon areas as set forth in the Master Deed on 
areas designated as limited common elements as long as they provide the following to the 
Association’s Management Company within seven (7) days after the installation:</p>

<ol>
<li>A completed OTARD Installation Information Sheet, in a form similar to that 
attached hereto as Exhibit “B”, in order for the Association to determine if the 
installation will create a safety hazard for persons or property and is installed in the 
proper areas.</li>
<li>The OTARD Installation Information Sheet must contain the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>a. The specific brand, model, size and installation location of the OTARD;</li>
<li>b. A copy of the manufacturers requirements or instructions for installations;</li>
<li>c. A Certification that the OTARD will be, or is grounded by a licensed 
electrician to prevent lightning from traveling into the building. The 
Certification should be in a form similar to that attached hereto as Exhibit 
“C”, and signed by the licensed electrician.</li>
<li>d. A description of where the OTARD will be, or is located wholly within the 
exclusive ownership, use or control of the resident, as recommended by the 
service provider or installer (if more than one location is suggested or 
available, please include all options);</li>
<li>e. An OTARD may only be placed upon property that is wholly within the 
exclusive ownership, use or control of the resident installing the OTARD, 
without damaging the Common Elements. It can not extend beyond the 
footprint of the area wholly within the exclusive ownership, use or control 
of the resident.</li>
<li>f. Attaching the OTARD to any part of the Common Elements by drilling or 
any other method is not permitted unless specifically approved by the 
Association.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Association in advance. No drilling into the Common Elements is permitted without prior written permission.</p>

<p>g. The resident may not install a DBS, MDS, or TOA which is greater than one (1) meter in diameter or diagonal measurement.</p>

<p>h. Any resident who installs an OTARD will be responsible for the entire cost of its maintenance, repair and removal, if necessary.</p>

<p>i. The resident will be required to move and/or remove the OTARD during any required repair, maintenance and replacement of the area immediately around the OTARD if required by the Association for access. If the resident fails to move and/or remove the OTARD within seven (7) days of any request, the Association may do so at the residents sole risk, cost and expense.</p>

<p>j. The resident will paint the OTARD to match the color of the adjacent building and/or screen as much of the OTARD as possible from view of the Common Elements as long as the painting or screening does not impair the signal of the OTARD or unreasonably delay or increase the cost of the installation.</p>

<p>k. All cable lines and wires to the OTARD must be placed in a safe manner and reasonably hidden from view of the Common Elements.</p>

<p><b>C.</b> All OTARD Installation Information Sheets (Exhibit <span style="color:red;">“B”</span>) must be delivered to the Association at its managing agent's office within seven (7) days after the installation.</p>

<p><b>D.</b> Any resident who does not comply with the requirements of the Master Deed or this Resolution, or installs the OTARD on the Common Elements, will be fined and maybe required to remove the improvement, restore the area to its original condition and pay for all costs incurred as a result thereof. If the OTARD is required to be removed and the resident does not arrange and pay for the removal, the Association may remove the OTARD, and restore the area. The cost for removal and restoration will be a lien on the resident’s Unit, collectible in the same manner as a Common Expense and the Owner will also be responsible for all costs of collection incurred by the Association.</p>

<p><b>E.</b> The Managing Agent will review each OTARD Installation Information Sheet submitted for completeness in accordance with these procedures. Upon submission of a completed application, the managing agent shall forward the OTARD Installation Information Sheet to the Board of Trustees for review.</p>

<p><b>F.</b> OTARD Installation Information Sheets will be reviewed by the Board of Trustees on an individual basis. The Board of Trustees will review the complete OTARD Installation Information Sheet and installation. The Board or Managing Agent will notify the Resident in writing if it finds that the installation or placement of the OTARD violates this Resolution,</p>

    <li>Attached to a sufficiently weighted base</li>

<p><b>J.</b> Residents must notify the Association within seven (7) business days after the installation of the OTARD, that it has been installed so that the Association may inspect same to ensure that all terms and conditions of this Resolution have been met.

<p><b>K.</b> Residents will be required to execute the Indemnification Agreement attached hereto as “Exhibit A” within seven (7) business days after the installation of the OTARD, or be subject to a fine for each day thereafter it is not received by the Association.</p>

    <h1>I <b>ROUTINE COLLECTIONS</b></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>All annual assessments may be paid in equal monthly installments as determined by the Board.</li>
        <li>All monthly installments shall be due and payable in advance on the first day of the month, whether or not a Member has received a statement regarding payment of same. The Association may as a convenience to the Members send out monthly statements and/or coupon books to remind Members of their obligation to pay the monthly installments.</li>
        <li>Non-receipt of a monthly statement and/or coupon book will in no way relieve the Member of the obligation to pay the amount due by the due date.</li>
        <li>All documents, correspondence, and notices relating to assessments, charges and or non-payment will be mailed to the Member at their address on the books of the Association, or as modified in writing by the Member, and may be sent to the mortgagee of the Unit, if known to the Association. The costs of these mailings may be added to the account and be a part of the continuing lien for assessments.</li>
        <li>A Statement of Account shall be sufficient notice of delinquency. The Association may, in addition to routine Statements of Account, send collection letters as, in its discretion, it deems appropriate. The first collection letter sent out by the Association must be sent no earlier than the 30th of any month in which the maintenance fee is delinquent. The first collection letter shall state that if the account is not paid in full within thirty (30) days of the letter, the Member’s right to pay in monthly installments will be revoked, the annual assessment will be accelerated, and the Member’s, as well as their Tenant’s, privileges will be suspended.</li>
        <li>If an account is still delinquent Thirty (30) days after the first collection letter by the Managing Agent, a collection letter shall be sent out by the Association's attorney.</li>

    <h1>II <b>REMEDIES FOR NONPAYMENT OF ASSESSMENT</b></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Monthly installment payments are due on the first day of each month.</li>
        <li>If payment of an installment is not received within Fifteen (15) days of its due date, the account will be deemed late and a late charge of Twenty-five ($25.00) dollars will automatically be added to that account. This late charge will be added to the account every fifteen (15) days the account has an outstanding balance.</li>
        <li>If full payment of the amount in arrears, including late charges, counsel fees and costs, etc., is not received by the Association within thirty (30) days after mailing the</li>

    <p>first collection letter by the Association's Managing Agent, then the matter will be turned over to the Association's attorney who will forward a collection letter.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The attorney's letter will inform the Member that if payment is not received within thirty (30) days of the date of the attorney collection letter, a lien will be placed against the Unit and a complaint filed, with all costs and attorney's fees for such action to be added to their account. The amount due at this time will include all attorney's fees and costs, including but not limited to the reasonable cost for a title search, filing and discharge of lien, in addition to such other costs as may be allowable by law.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Any money collected from delinquent Members will be applied to their account as follows:</p>
<p>First, to satisfy attorney fees and costs of litigation; <br>
Second, to satisfy any late fees and interest; <br>
Third, to satisfy any processing fees; <br>
Fourth, to satisfy outstanding fines; <br>
Fifth, to satisfy any special assessments; and <br>
Sixth, to satisfy assessment obligations.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> If the Association receives from any Member, in any accounting year, two or more returned checks for payment of assessments, the Board may require all future payments to be made by certified check or money order for the remainder of the fiscal year. Any bank fees and administration fees charged to the Association will be charged and added to the account for any returned checks.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Association membership rights of any Member and/or tenant of that Member whose account is thirty (30) days past due will be suspended during the period that any installment, charge or assessment remains unpaid, subject to the terms of the Governing Documents.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Delinquent Members shall be liable for the amount of assessments, late fees, reasonable attorneys fees, interest, costs of suit, costs of filing and processing fee (if any) prior to reinstatement of their membership rights. These payments must also be made to the Association prior to the discharge of any lien.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Should the Unit Owner become delinquent in his maintenance fees or other charges, the Association may request that a tenant make payment to the Association of the rent and that the Association will apply same to the Unit Owner's outstanding balance. Any surplus will be sent to the Unit Owner. Failure of the tenant to make payment of rent to the Association will be a violation of these rules and regulations and subject to the remedies set forth herein.</p>

    <p>Managing Agent, in writing, that the Respondent requests a hearing. The 
answer and request for a hearing shall be sent by the Respondent to the 
Managing Agent via regular and certified mail, return receipt requested. If 
the Respondent does not file a written answer and request a hearing within 
ten (10) days of receipt of the Complaint and/or cease and desist letter, the 
Respondent will be deemed to have waived his/her rights to request a hearing 
and default will be entered against him/her. If default is entered against the 
Respondent, then the allegations contained within the Complaint and/or cease

entered against the Respondent, the Managing Agent may impose any fines, 
penalties and/or sanctions as authorized by this Resolution or the Governing 
Documents, as permitted by Article III, Section D below.</p>

<p><b>B. The Hearing.</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>No hearing shall take place or be conducted unless the Committee consists 
  of at least (i) three Committee members or (ii) one Certified Mediator 
  present at the hearing.</li>

  <li>If a Certified Mediator is not used, than the Committee must select an 
  impartial individual to preside as hearing officer over the hearing. It is the 
  duty of the hearing officer to explain the rules and procedures by which the 
  hearing is to be conducted. Generally, any relevant evidence may be admitted 
  and hearsay evidence may be used to supplement or explain other evidence, 
  but will not be sufficient in itself to support a decision.</li>

  <li>Any Unit Owner, Resident, or the Association, may request a Certified 
  Mediator, in addition to, or in lieu of, a Committee review, for any covenants 
  violations and/or disputes between individual unit owners and the 
  association, and/or between different unit owners. The individual or entity 
  who requests the Certified Mediator shall be solely responsible for any costs 
  or fees charged by the mediator, arbitrator and/or service provider. If the 
  mediator is selected through the Community Associations Institute, the 
  responsible party for payment may use the Association’s membership number 
  to receive a discounted fee, if any. The Certified Mediator would then be 
  empowered to assess, or apportion, to either party or both, the costs of the 
  Certified Mediator, as he or she reasonably determines.</li>

  <li>At the hearing each party has the right to:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>make a statement;</li>
      <li>introduce evidence, testimony, and witnesses;</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<h4>IV. <b>RIGHT TO APPEAL</b></h4>

<p>Any action, ruling, decision or fine imposed by the Committee may be appealed to a Court of competent jurisdiction by any aggrieved party within forty-five (45) days of the aggrieved party's notice of the decision. If the aggrieved party fails to file a timely appeal within the fifty-five (45) [<font color="red">uncertain text</font>] day time limitation as set forth above, the aggrieved party shall lose its right to appeal the action, ruling, decision or fine imposed by the Managing Agent and/or Committee and the ruling shall become binding on all parties and shall have the full force and effect under the laws of New Jersey.</p>

<h4>V. <b>MEDIATION:</b></h4>

<p>Prior to the commencement of any court appeal or binding arbitration agreed to by the parties, any party to the dispute or the Committee may request mediation of the dispute by an impartial mediator appointed by the Committee. Additionally, if the Committee determines that a dispute is subject to mediation it shall provide to the Respondent a written offer of mediation within 45 days of the Committee becoming aware of the dispute, and require that the Respondent accept its offer of mediation within 10 business days following its mailing. If the Respondent does not accept the offer of mediation within such time frame, the Committee shall have no further obligation to offer mediation. The mediator may be a member of the Committee, the Association attorney, or any other qualified mediator. If mediation does not result in a written agreement between the parties to resolve the dispute, the mediator may act in the capacity of a arbitrator and issue a written decision concerning the matter that is subject to mediation. Such decision shall become binding only if none of the parties to the mediation files a suit in connection with the mediation matters within 45 days following the mailing of the written decision.</p>

    <p><b>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT</b> the following Resolution be adopted 
to provide guidelines for the replacement and installation of windows and doors, including storm 
doors:</p>

<p><b>DOOR AND WINDOW INSTALLATION AND REPLACEMENT GUIDELINES</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>At the Unit Owner's sole cost and expense, windows may be installed or replaced with a 
    window subject to Board approval. The Board has pre-approved the window designs and 
    models as detailed in Schedule A.</li>

    <li>At the Unit Owner's sole cost and expense, patio doors, may be installed or replaced with 
    a door subject to Board approval. The Board has pre-approved the "patio" door (the door 
    that leads into the living room of the unit <span style="color:red;">[from the deck]</span>) models as detailed in Schedule B.</li>

    <p>At the Unit Owner's sole cost and expense, storm doors, may be installed or replaced with 
    a door subject to Board approval. The Board has pre-approved the storm door models as 
    detailed in Schedule B.</p>

    <p>The Association in no way endorses the use of the doors and/or windows which are reference 
    in the Schedules attached, or any contractor, nor does it warrantee the window and/or door, 
    or any work performed to install same. The Board merely approves the Unit Owners use of 
    these windows and doors, if the Unit Owner so chooses. It is the Unit Owner's responsibility 
    and obligation to check into the quality of the door/window installer.</p>

    <li>The color of all storm doors must be dark chocolate brown in color. The design of the storm 
    door must be "full view (glass)", "half glass" or "two half glass panels" and match the 
    designs of the storm doors as set forth in Schedule "B" to maintain a uniform and desirable 
    appearance.</li>

    <li>Residents must contact the Association in writing if they are going to replace or install doors 
    and/or windows, per the above guidelines and fill out a property modification form available, 
    from Management which shall be in the initial form as set forth in Schedule "C".</li>

    <li>The Unit Owners are free to use any contractor they desire to install the doors and/or 
    windows. However, the unit owner must provide a copy of Contractor's certificate of 
    insurance to the Association showing adequate coverage to cover any damages they may 
    cause as a result of their services, prior to work commencing.</li>

    <li>Should the Unit Owner, or his Contractor, cause damage to the Limited Common or 
    Common Elements, in connection with his replacement/installation of a door and/or window, 
    that Unit Owner shall be responsible for any and all damage done to those Common 
    Elements.</li>

In the event that I perform the work myself, I will provide proof of coverage for the Association through a policy I have secured. The Association is named as an "additional insured" on the policy or certificate of insurance coverage.

I understand and do hereby confirm that the approval of the proposed work by the Association does in no way affect my obligation to determine and to comply with applicable legal requirements.

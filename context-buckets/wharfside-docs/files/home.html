  <h2>Wharfside Governing Documents</h2>
  <h1>Welcome to the Transcribed Documents Website</h1>
  <div class="explanation">
    <p>This website displays transcriptions of scanned documents that have been processed using an advanced transcription model (GPT-4o).</p>
    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> The model transcribes all visible printed text from each scanned page. Handwritten annotations—such as dates, checkmarks, or initials—are enclosed in curly brackets. For example, a handwritten "J.D." appears as <span class="annotation">{J.D.}</span>.</p>
    <p>If the model is uncertain about any part of the text, that portion is highlighted in <span class="note">red</span>. This red highlight serves as a cue for you to refer to the original scanned image for verification.</p>
    <p>Additionally, tables and bold text are formatted using simple HTML tags to retain their structure and emphasis.</p>
    <p>Use the sidebar on the left to navigate among the documents. Click "Home" at any time to view this information again.</p>

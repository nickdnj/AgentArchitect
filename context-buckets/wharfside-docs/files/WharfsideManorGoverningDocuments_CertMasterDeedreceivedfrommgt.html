<strong>31.</strong> The present title to the property hereby subdivided 
by GRANTOR, and the title to each Condominium 
Unit which shall be hereafter conveyed or acquired 
in any manner, is hereby expressly declared and 
made subject to the terms and provisions of this 
instrument and the acquisition of title by any 
person to a Unit shall be conclusively deemed 
to mean that acquirer approves, adopts and ratifies 
the provisions of this instrument, the By-laws

comply therewith. The covenants, agreements and 
restrictions set forth herein shall run with the 
land and shall be binding upon GRANTOR, its 
successors and assigns and by all persons claiming 
by, through or under GRANTOR, their heirs, 
executors, administrators and assigns.
</p>

<p>
It is the intention of the GRANTOR that the 
provisions of this instrument are severable so 
that if any provision, condition, covenant or 
restriction thereof shall be invalid or void under 
any applicable federal, state or local law, the 
remainder shall be unaffected thereby; in the 
event that any provision, condition, covenant 
or restriction thereof recording of this 
instrument, void, voidable or unenforceable as 
being contrary to any applicable federal, state 
or local law, the GRANTOR, its successors and 
assigns and all persons claiming by, through or 
under GRANTOR, covenant and agree that any future 
amendments or supplements to the said law having 
the effect of removing said invalidity, voidability 
or unenforceability, shall be deemed to apply 
retrospectively to this instrument which otherwise 
might be invalid and it is covenanted and agreed 
that any such amendments and supplements to the 
said laws shall have the effect herein declared 
as fully as if they had been in effect at the 
time of the execution of this instrument.

<strong>32.</strong> The GRANTOR herewith expressly reserves unto 
itself, its successors and assigns, the exclusive 
right to amend, supplement, revise, rescind or 
revoke this Declaration of Restrictive and 
Protective Covenants, in whole or in part, at 
any time prior to the closing of title to any 
individual unit forming a part of the Condominium 
Property.

This Master Deed may be amended at any time after the date hereof by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of all Unit Owners at any meeting of the ASSOCIATION duly held in accordance with the provisions of the By-Laws provided, however, that any amendment so requiring it, shall also have the prior written approval of mortgagee having an interest in the Condominium or a Unit therein. No amendment shall be effective until recorded in the Office of the Clerk of Monmouth County, New Jersey.

<p>34. The fact that some or all of the officers, Directors, Members or Employees of the ASSOCIATION and the GRANTOR may be identical, and the fact that the GRANTOR or its nominees, have heretofore or may hereafter enter into agreements with the ASSOCIATION or with third parties, will not invalidate any such agreements and the ASSOCIATION and its Members, from time to time, will be obligated to abide by and comply with the terms and conditions thereof.

of interest in the Common Elements contained within the Entire 
tract.</p>

<p>WHEREAS, <strong>N.J.S.A. 46:8B-14(j)</strong> provides that “[a]n association shall exercise its powers and discharge its functions in a manner that protects and furthers or is not inconsistent with the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the community[;]” and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, Article 7 of the Master Deed provides that, “[p]ursuant to the requirements of the Condominium Act of the State of New Jersey, [the] Association is hereby designated as the form of administration of the Condominium and the said Association is hereby vested with the rights, powers, privileges and duties necessary to or incidental to the proper administration of the Condominium... The said Association shall also be empowered to exercise any of the rights, powers, privileges or duties, which may, from time to time, be established by law or which may be delegated to it by the owner or co-owners of Units in the Condominium[;]” and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, Article IV, Section 1 of the Association’s By-Laws provides that “[t]he affairs of the Association shall be governed by a Board of Trustees…”;</p>

<p>WHEREAS, Article VI, Section 14 of the Association’s By-Laws provides that “[t]he Board of Trustees shall have and exercise all lawful powers and duties necessary for the proper conduct and administration of the affairs of the Association and the operation and maintenance of the Condominium and may do or cause to be done all such other lawful acts and things as are not by law, by these By-Laws or otherwise, directed or required to be done or exercised by members of the Association or owners of units, or by others[;]” and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, Article VI, Section 14(R)(1)-(2) of the Association’s By-Laws provides that “[t]he ASSOCIATION shall be required to obtain and maintain, to the extent obtainable, the following insurance upon the Common Elements and upon equipment and personal property owned by the ASSOCIATION. The policies so obtained shall be for the benefit and protection of the ASSOCIATION and the owners of the Units and their respective mortgages as their interests may appear. Such policies shall include provisions that they be without contribution, that improvements to Units made by Unit Owners shall not affect the valuation of the Property for the purposes of Insurance and that the insurer waives its rights of subrogation as to any claims against Unit Owners, the ASSOCIATION and their respective employees, servants, agents and guests. The coverages shall be against the hereinafter enumerated perils and contingencies:</p>

(b) if the project contains a steam boiler, a broad-form policy of repair and replacement 
boiler and machinery insurance of at least $50,000 per accident per location; and

(c) a ‘master’ or ‘blanket’ policy of flood insurance on the buildings and any other property 
covered by the required form of policy in an amount deemed appropriate but not less than

(d) such other risks as are customarily covered in similar projects.

(2) A comprehensive policy of public liability insurance covering all of the Common 
Elements in the Condominium Property with a Severability of Interest Endorsement or equivalent 
coverage which would preclude the insurer from denying the claim of a unit Owner because of the 
negligent acts of the ASSOCIATION or another Unit Owner, with limits not less than $1,000,000 
covering all claims for personal injury and/or property damage arising out of a single occurrence, 
including protection against water damage liability, liability for nonowned and hired automobile, 
liability for property of others and, if applicable, elevator collision, garagekeeper’s liability, host 
liquor liability, and such other risks as are customarily covered in similar projects. Any such policy 
shall be subject to Federal National Mortgage Association or Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation approval, if applicable[;]" and

<b>WHEREAS</b>, Article VI, Section 14(R)(4) of the Association’s By-Laws provides that 
"[a]ny insurance obtained shall be subject to the following: (a) the named insured under any such 
policies shall be the ASSOCIATION, as trustee for the Owners of the Units, or its authorized 
representative, . . . (b) insurance coverage obtained and maintained may not be brought into 
contribution with insurance purchased by the owners of the Units or their mortgages; (c) coverage

neglect is not within the control of the ASSOCIATION or (b) any failure of the ASSOCIATION 
to comply with any warranty or condition regarding any portion of the premises over which the 
ASSOCIATION has no control; (d) coverage may not be canceled or substantially modified

to any and all insureds; (e) all policies must contain a waiver of subrogation by the insurer as to 
any and all claims against the ASSOCIATION, the Owner of any Unit and/or their respective 
agents, employees or tenants, and of any defenses based on co-insurance or on invalidity arising 
from the acts of the insured; (f) all policies of property insurance must provide that, despite any

“[a]ll insurance policies maintained by the ASSOCIATION shall be for the benefit of the 
ASSOCIATION and the Unit Owners, and their mortgagees, as their respective interest may

the Units and the bathroom and kitchen fixtures initially installed therein by the Creator but not 
including carpeting, drapes, wall covering, fixtures, furniture, furnishings, or other personal 
property supplied or installed by Unit Owners) together with all air-conditioning equipment and 
other service machinery contained therein and covering the interest of the Condominium Property, 
the Board of Trustees and all Unit Owners and their mortgagees, as their interest may appear in 
the amount determined by the Board of Trustees, each of which policies shall contain a standard 
mortgage clause in favor of each mortgagee of a Unit which shall provide that the loss, if any, 
thereunder shall be payable to such mortgagee as its interest may appear, subject, however, to the 
loss payment provisions in favor of the Board of Trustees. All such policies shall provide that 
adjustment of loss shall be made by the Board of Trustees and that the net proceeds thereof shall 
be payable to the ASSOCIATION, subject to rights of the Units [sic] Trustee.”</p>

<p>Premiums for any such insurance coverage shall be included in the monthly assessment for 
Common Expenses and such premium charges shall be held in a separate escrow account of the 
ASSOCIATION to be used solely for the payment of said premiums, as same become due.</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Board has determined that it is in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of all Association members to promulgate the Insurance Deductible Resolution.</p>

    <b>Capitalized Terms.</b> Unless specifically defined otherwise, all capitalized terms used in this resolution, other than those appearing in caption headings, have the same meaning as defined in the Master Deed, Bylaws and the other governing documents of the Association.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Application of Insurance Proceeds.</b> If and to the extent the Association receives insurance proceeds pursuant to insurance policies placed, maintained, and paid for by the Association, which proceeds represent, in whole or in part, a reimbursement for repairing or restoring damage caused to a Unit or the real property of a Unit Owner, then and in such event the proceeds shall be applied to the cost of restoring damage to (a) the Common Elements and condominium property and; (b) the Unit, in proportion to the amount of damage suffered by each. In the event of damage to multiple Units, the amount, if any, available to the Unit Owners shall be prorated between the affected Unit Owners on an equitable basis as determined in the discretion of the Board. The costs of repair and restoration determined by the Association’s insurance carrier, as approved by the Board, shall be utilized in determining the apportionment of proceeds between Unit Owners or between a Unit Owner(s) and the Association. The amount to be paid to a Unit Owner shall be net of the deductible as more specifically described in Paragraph 3 below.

  <li>
    <b>Deductibles.</b> Notwithstanding the terms of paragraph 2 above, the Board has determined that it is equitable and appropriate to allocate responsibility for the insurance deductible, between the Association and the affected Unit Owner or Unit Owners when there is damage resulting from an insurable event that affects any part of the Common Elements and one or more Units. Therefore, where the Association suffers damage from a single insurable event involving Common Elements and one or more Units, the responsibility for the deductible will be calculated as follows: the total cost for repairing or restoring the insurable portions of Common Elements, property of the Association and individual Units shall be divided by the total cost of restoring all insurable damages to property owned or managed by each party (the Association and Unit Owners affected), with the resultant fraction or percentage being referred to as each party's “Share of Damage”. The insurance companies’ calculation of the value of damage to each party’s property, as accepted by the Association, shall be used to determine each Party’s Share of Damages. Each party’s Share of Damage shall be multiplied by the amount of the insurance deductible and die each party shall be responsible for paying the portion of the deductible relating to its Share of Damage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if damage is sustained to a portion of the Common Elements and/or units of the Association and said damage is caused by an item that a

    <p>Unit Owner is responsible to maintain, replace and/or repair (the “Responsible Unit Owner”) and said damage is covered by the Association’s insurance policy, the Responsible Unit Owner shall be responsible for the payment of any insurance deductible.</p>

<p>Where the Association suffers damage from a single insurable event that does not affect any part of the Common Elements or other property of the Association, the Unit Owner or Owners shall be responsible for payment of the entire insurance deductible. If multiple units are affected by such an event, the Unit Owners’ respective responsibilities for the entire deductible shall be allocated based upon each Unit Owner’s Share of Damage, as determined by the insurance company and agreed to by the Board. The Association shall not be responsible for payment of any portion of an insurance deductible when there is an insurable event that does not affect any part of the Common Elements or other property belonging to the Association.</p>

<p><strong>4. Claims Below Deductible Amount.</strong> Where there is damage to a Unit that requires repair or restoration that costs less than the amount of the deductible maintained under the policy of property damage insurance procured by the Association, the Unit Owner shall be responsible for the entire cost of the repair or restoration. If the casualty event involves both the Common Elements and one or more Units, the responsibility for the repair or restoration shall be calculated as set forth in paragraph 3 above.</p>

<p><strong>B. HO6 POLICY</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Review of Owner Coverage.</strong> The Unit Owners are advised to review their personal casualty insurance policies, commonly referred to as an HO-6 policy, covering their respective Units and are urged to consult with their insurance agents and/or carriers concerning this Resolution and the appropriate amounts and types of insurance coverage and deductibles. The Unit Owners are also advised to consult with the Association and/or its insurance agent in order to determine, from time to time, the amount of casualty insurance coverage deductible being maintained by the Association in order that the Unit Owners are able to insure that portion of the Association’s deductible under their HO-6 policy.</li>

  <li>It is strongly recommended that each Unit Owner obtain and keep in full force and effect, an “HO6” homeowner’s insurance policy (“HO6”) for his/her own benefit, with a maximum $500.00 deductible.</li>

  <li>The liability of the carriers issuing insurance covering the Association shall not be affected nor diminished by reason of any such additional insurance carried by any Unit Owners and all such policies shall contain waivers of subrogation.</li>

  <li>The Association shall be named as the additional insured on all HO6 Policies.</li>

  <li>A certificate of such HO6 Policy shall be furnished to the Association annually, upon notice by management, which certificate by its terms shall provide that the policy shall not be terminated without at least 30 days prior written notice to the Association.</li>

<ol>
<li>It is reasonable and appropriate to impose a fine not to exceed $100.00 for a violation of any provisions of the Master Deed, By-Laws, Resolutions and any Rules and Regulations and decisions of the Board promulgated under the proper authority of the Board (collectively, the "Governing Documents").</li>

<li>A fine shall be imposed for each day the violation(s) of the Governing Documents continue until said violation(s) is/are abated.

No Unit Owner shall be subject to a fine of more than $2,000.00 for each continuing violation.</li>

<li>Fines may be imposed upon Unit Owners ten (10) days following the delivery of written notice of the violation to the physical address of the offending Unit by regular mail or via hand delivery.

    <p>
5. Since each Unit Owner is deemed responsible for the conduct of all occupants of his Unit and their guests, fines may be imposed upon the Unit Owner(s) for the conduct of any tenants, guests or occupants for any violation of the Governing Documents.
</p>
<p>
6. Any monies due hereunder shall constitute a lien on the offending Unit and be collected in the same manner as assessments. The Association shall have the right to seek appropriate legal action against any offending Unit Owner in order to obtain payment of fines imposed in connection with a violation of the Governing Documents and decisions of the Board, and, in addition, shall be entitled to a judgment for all fees and costs incurred in such action.
</p>
<p>
7. The membership rights of any Unit Owner may be suspended by the Association for any period during which any fines remain unpaid, subject to the provisions hereof, upon payment of such monies. Rights and privileges shall be immediately and automatically restored upon full payment of same.
</p>
<p>
8. The Board may suspend the rights and privileges of any Unit Owner in violation of the Governing Documents for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days for any single violation, but if the violation is of a continuing nature, such rights and privileges may be suspended indefinitely until the violation is abated.
</p>
<p>
9. Notwithstanding the above, the Association may exercise all rights and remedies available to it at law, in equity and/or pursuant to the Governing Documents.

<p>
10. If any provision herein is determined to be invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

11. Any provision contained within any previously adopted resolution of the Association which conflicts with any provisions set forth herein shall be deemed void and the provision contained herein shall govern.

<p>Lease Dated ____________</p>

<p>It is hereby agreed as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>TENANTS DUTY TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE MASTER DEED, BY-LAWS AND RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATION</b>

    <p>Tenant and Landlord acknowledge that this Lease is subject to all of the provisions of the Master Deed for the Association and the By-laws which govern the Association (collectively referred to as the “Governing Documents”), any Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder including, but not limited to, any determination/decision made by the Board of Directors of the Association relating to the use and possession of the subject condominium unit as well as to the use of all common elements at the Association’s complex.</p>

    <p>Tenant and Landlord further acknowledge that any failure of the Tenant to fully comply with the terms and conditions of the Governing Documents and decisions shall constitute a material default under this Lease and be grounds for termination and eviction.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>LANDLORD’S APPOINTMENT OF CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION AS LANDLORD’S ATTORNEY-IN-FACT</b>

    <p>In the event the Tenant fails to comply with the provisions of the Governing Documents or any determination/decision made by the Board of Directors of the Association, then, in addition to all other remedies which it may have, the Association shall notify the Landlord of such violation(s) and demand that same be remedied through the Landlord’s efforts within thirty (30) days after such notice. If such violation(s) is not remedied within said thirty (30) day period, then the Landlord shall immediately thereafter, at his own cost and expense, institute and diligently prosecute an eviction action against the tenant on account of such violation(s). Such action shall not be compromised or settled without the prior written consent of the Association.</p>

    <p>In the event the Landlord fails to fulfill the foregoing obligation, then the Association shall have the right to institute and prosecute such eviction action as attorney-in-fact for the Landlord and at the Landlord’s sole cost and expense, including all attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred. Landlord acknowledges that said fees and costs shall be deemed to constitute a lien on his condominium unit and that collection thereof may be enforced</p>

    <p>by the Association in the same manner as the Association is entitled to enforce collection of common expenses and assessments.</p>

<p>By execution of this Condominium Lease Rider, the Landlord does thereby automatically and irrevocably name, constitute, and appoint the Association as his/her attorney-in-fact for the purposes described herein.</p>

<p><b>3. PROHIBITION AGAINST ASSIGNMENT</b></p>

<p>The Tenant, without first securing prior written approval from the Association may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>assign this lease;</li>
<li>sublet all or any part of the unit; and</li>
<li>permit any other person to use the unit.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>4. ASSOCIATION’S RIGHT OF ACCESS TO UNIT</b></p>

<p>Tenant and Landlord recognize and acknowledge that the Association shall have access to the unit from time to time during reasonable hours as may be necessary for the maintenance, repair or replacement of any common elements(s) therein or accessible therefrom or for making emergency repairs necessary to prevent damage to common elements or to any other unit or units. No such notice shall be required for emergency situations.</p>

<p><b>5. LANDLORD’S ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS TO ASSOCIATION</b></p>

<p>Landlord herein acknowledges that the execution of this Lease and Condominium Lease Rider does not operate to relieve Landlord of his obligation to pay his unit’s proportionate share of the common expenses and assessments required by the Association. As security for the performance of Landlord’s continued obligation to pay his unit’s proportionate share of common expenses and assessments, Landlord herein assigns to the Association the rent payable to him by the Tenant.</p>

<p>Said assignment of rent shall, however, only become operative upon the Landlord’s failure to timely pay his unit’s proportionate share of common expenses and assessments after having been given thirty (30) days written notice by the Association as to his default. Upon Landlord’s failure to cure his default within said thirty (30) day period, the Association can, without having to institute any court action or proceeding, demand of Tenant that Tenant pay over to the Association any and all rent due Landlord under the terms of the lease.</p>

<p>Tenant herein covenants to fully cooperate with the Association and to remit rent directly to the Association if so demanded by the Association.</p>

<p>Rent received by the Association from the Tenant shall be applied as follows:</p>

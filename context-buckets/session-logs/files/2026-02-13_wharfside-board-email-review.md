## Context for Next Session

Wharfside is dealing with an extended cold weather event causing frozen/broken pipes across the property. Management (Kathy Vanecek at East Coast/Ideal Management) is overwhelmed with work orders. A rolloff dumpster is being ordered for debris. The special meeting Monday is a quick vote to seat Linda as trustee. The insurance renewal is tracking well with significant premium reductions. The Bldg 8 hot water heater may resurface as an issue if it fails again.
